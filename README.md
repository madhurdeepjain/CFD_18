This web app aims to predict the natural disasters and help government and community in tackling them. There are mainly 3 sections:

1. Future Predictions 
2. Major ongoing or recent events
3. Emergency Section

### Future Predictions
This section contains the pre-trained models over various major disasters. We will apply machine learning and deep learning techinques on the available dataset to predict the forthcoming disasters.The models will be trained using Tensorflow lib, sklearn lib and Microsoft CNTK Toolkit. These models will be loaded in the browser via TensorflowJs. The dataset features will be different for each disaster. The dataset has been scraped and mined from various authentic sources like Satelite Data, Twitter, etc. <br/>
We also plan to propose sensors that can be used by cities/states to improve the probability of prediction. These Sensors are part of our smart city idea to implement IoT devices in order to get real time and improved predictions. 

### Major ongoing or recent events
This section includes the disasters that have happened in the last month or are currently ongoing. For each city/state their helpline numbers will be provided specific to the location of Event.</br>
Also details of associated relief funds will be mentioned to which people can donate.

### Emergency Section
This Section will contain a short form for the person in urgent help. The form data filled in by the person will be collected and formated using NLP and send to his/her relatives and the NGOs nearest to their location via text messages, voice messages and mails.

Apart from these sections there are two other sections:
1. General Guidelines
2. Statistics

### General Guidelines 
Along with it a framework will be designed to provid basic guidlines for people struck in these disasters.

### Statistics
This section shows our analysis of disasters during the course of last 50-60 years. The data is presented in statistical and graphical format.
