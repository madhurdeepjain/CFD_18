This web app aims to predict the natural disasters and help government and community in tackling them. There are mainly 2 sections:
1. To Happen
2. Happned
### To Happen
This section involves the predicting model of our app. We will apply machine learning models on the available dataset to predict the forthcoming disasters. The dataset features will be different for each disaster. 
We also plan to propose sensors that can be used by cities/states to improve the probability of prediction.
### Happened
This section includes the disasters that have happened in the last month with respect to the user's time. For each city/state there are helpline numbers specific to it. Also details of associated relief funds are mentioned to which people can donate.

Apart from these sections there are two other sections:
1. General Guidelines
2. Statistics
### General Guidelines
This contains general guidelines to be followed before and after each disaster.
### Statistics
This section shows our analysis of disasters during the course of last 50-60 years.

**Note:** The idea is under development phase.
